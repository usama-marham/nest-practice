Nice — solid feature set. Below I’ll give you a clear, production-minded plan (no code yet) for an **Auth module** in Nest + Prisma that’s secure, testable, and scalable. I’ll include the **high-level flows**, recommended **endpoints**, folder layout, responsibilities for each component, security best practices, and an incremental rollout plan (so you can implement & test step-by-step).

---

# 1 — Goals / constraints

- Use **bcrypt** for password hashing (OK) — note Argon2 is stronger if you want to swap later.
- Issue **JWT access tokens** for auth; keep them short-lived.
- Provide **signup, login, /me** and other useful endpoints (logout, refresh token, verify email, reset password).
- Use **Prisma** as DB layer.
- Use Nest best practices: modularity, DTOs + class-validator, Passport strategies, Guards, ConfigService, global validation pipe, proper error handling and logging, tests, and observability.
- Make it safe for large scale & maintainable.

---

# 2 — High-level flows

### Signup (register)

1. Client POSTs `email, password, firstName, lastName, ...`.
2. Server validates input DTO.
3. Check if active user with same email exists (`deletedAt: null`) — conflict → 409.
4. Hash password (bcrypt) and create user with `passwordHash` and `emailVerified: false`.
5. Create an email verification token (secure random string, stored hashed with expiry) and send email (background job).
6. Return `201 Created` (do **not** return token on signup unless email verification is immediate).

### Login

1. Client POSTs `email, password`.
2. Validate DTO. Find active user with given email.
3. If not found or password mismatch → return `401 Unauthorized` (generic message).
4. If user exists but not email-verified → optionally block or allow limited access depending on policy.
5. Issue **access token (short-lived)** and **refresh token (longer-lived)**.

   - Access token: JWT signed with private key or HMAC secret; minimal claims (user id, role, maybe scopes).
   - Refresh token: either JWT or random opaque token; store a **hashed** copy in DB with device/session info + expiry.

6. Send access token in response body and set refresh token as **HttpOnly Secure SameSite cookie** (or response body depending on client type). Prefer cookie for browser clients.
7. Return `200 OK` with user public profile + access token (or rely on cookie).

### Refresh token

1. Client calls `/auth/refresh` with refresh token (cookie or body).
2. Server validates token against DB (hashed), checks expiry and rotation rules.
3. Optionally implement **refresh token rotation**: issue a new refresh token, invalidate the old one (store rotated token fingerprint).
4. Return new access token (and new refresh token cookie).

### Logout

1. Client calls `/auth/logout`.
2. Server invalidates refresh token(s) for that session (delete DB row or mark revoked) and clears cookie.
3. Return `204 No Content` or `200`.

### /me (profile)

1. Protected route (JWT Auth Guard).
2. Returns authenticated user’s safe profile (no password/refresh tokens).
3. Use JWT guard to extract user id and fetch user from DB (respect soft deletes).

### Email verification & password reset

- Verification: token created on signup, sent via email with link pointing to `/auth/verify?token=...`. API validates & marks `emailVerified=true`.
- Password reset: create one-time token, send email. Reset endpoint verifies token, allows set new password (hash & store), revoke refresh tokens.

---

# 3 — Token design recommendations

### Access token

- Short expiry (e.g., 5–15 minutes).
- Signed JWT (HS256 with secret or RS256 with keypair). RS256 + rotating keys is best for scale & key rotation.
- Minimal claims: `sub` (user id), `iat`, `exp`, `roles` or `scope` if needed.
- No sensitive info inside token.

### Refresh token

- Prefer **opaque token** (secure random token) stored hashed in DB; or a long-lived JWT but still store fingerprint. Opaque + DB is more secure (easy to revoke).
- Store session metadata (userId, issuedAt, expiresAt, ip, userAgent).
- Store refresh tokens hashed (never store raw tokens).
- Rotate refresh tokens on use (issue new refresh token, invalidate previous).
- Expiry: days to weeks.

### Token storage on client

- **Browser**: store refresh token in **HttpOnly Secure SameSite cookie**; store access token in memory (not localStorage) or use cookie as well and use CSRF protection.
- **Mobile/API**: use Authorization header `Bearer <access_token>` and refresh via refresh endpoint.

---

# 4 — Revocation / blacklisting / logout

- Use DB-stored refresh tokens per-session; revoke by deleting row.
- Access tokens expire quickly; if you need immediate access-token revocation, you need a blacklist (cache like Redis) — expensive. Prefer short access token lifetime + refresh token revocation.

---

# 5 — Security hardening & operational considerations

- Use **bcrypt** with reasonable work factor (e.g., cost 12). Consider Argon2 later.
- Use **HTTPS always**; set `Secure` for cookies.
- Use **Helmet**, CORS rules (strict), and rate limiting for auth endpoints.
- Implement **account lockout** and exponential backoff after N failed login attempts (store counters per user/IP, consider Redis for rate).
- Protect against brute-force: per-IP throttling + per-account throttling.
- Implement **password complexity** and reuse policies as needed.
- Use **email verification** to ensure email ownership.
- Use **2FA (optional)** as future improvement (TOTP or SMS).
- **Rotate secrets** (JWT signing keys) using key IDs (kid) if using asymmetric keys.
- Log auth events (login, logout, failed attempts) to centralized logs & metrics but don’t log passwords.
- Securely store secrets via environment variables or secret stores (Vault, AWS Parameter Store).
- Use **refresh token rotation** to limit replay attacks.
- CSRF: if using cookies for auth, protect sensitive POST endpoints with CSRF tokens or SameSite cookie + custom header checks.
- Use **Prisma middleware or global policies** to respect soft-deleted users in auth flows.

---

# 6 — RBAC & Permissions

- Keep authorization separate: use a `roles`/`permissions` system:

  - Minimal: `role` enum on user and `RolesGuard` that checks required roles on a route via a `@Roles()` decorator.
  - For fine-grained access, keep a permission table or policy engine.

---

# 7 — DB models (Prisma) — high level (not exact code)

- `User` model: include `passwordHash`, `emailVerified`, `deletedAt`, `lastLoginAt`, `failedLoginAttempts`, `lockoutUntil`, `role`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
- `RefreshToken` model: `id`, `userId`, `tokenHash`, `expiresAt`, `createdAt`, `revokedAt`, `ip`, `userAgent`.
- `EmailToken` model (for verify/reset): `id`, `userId`, `type` (`VERIFY`/`RESET`), `tokenHash`, `expiresAt`, `usedAt`.
- Consider indexing on `userId`, `expiresAt`, `tokenHash`.

# 8 — Nest module layout (recommended)

```

  modules/
    auth/
      dto/
        login.dto.ts
        signup.dto.ts

# 9 — Responsibilities (who does what)

- **AuthController**: accepts requests, uses DTOs, calls AuthService; returns standardized responses.
- **AuthService**: orchestrates signup, login, logout, refresh, verify; talks to UserService and TokenService.
- **TokenService**: low-level token creation/verification (createAccessToken, createRefreshToken, hashToken, verifyRefreshToken, rotate).
- **UserService**: user CRUD, password update, user lookup with `deletedAt:null`.
- **JWT Strategy** (Passport): validates access token, attaches user payload to request.
- **Guards & Decorators**: `@Auth()`, `@Roles()` etc. to protect routes.
- **Email service** (separate module or 3rd party worker): sends verification/reset emails asynchronously (queue).

---

# 10 — DTOs & Validation (conceptual)

- `SignupDto`: email (IsEmail), password (MinLength + regex), optional profile fields; sanitized.
- `LoginDto`: email, password.
- `RefreshDto`: (if using body) refresh token; if cookie-based, guard reads cookie.
- `ResetPasswordDto`: token + newPassword.
- Use global validation pipe with `whitelist: true` and `forbidNonWhitelisted: true`.

---

# 11 — Error handling & responses

- Use global exception filter (you already added) to normalize errors.
- Return minimal error messages on auth failures (avoid leaking which field failed).
- Use `409 Conflict` for existing email on signup; `401 Unauthorized` for bad credentials; `403 Forbidden` for unverified or locked accounts if needed.

---

# 12 — Testing & CI

- Unit tests: AuthService (happy/failure flows), TokenService (issue/verify), guards.
- Integration tests: signup → verify → login → refresh → logout cycle.
- End-to-end tests for session flows and token rotation.
- Add tests for concurrency edge cases (duplicate signups).

---

# 13 — Incremental implementation plan (recommended)

1. Implement `User` model and persist `passwordHash`.
2. Build basic `signup` (hash password + create user) and `login` (verify password, create access token) with DTOs and validation. Use access token only first.
3. Add `me` route protected by JWT strategy.
4. Add refresh tokens (DB model) with cookie-based approach and implement `/refresh`.
5. Implement logout (revoke refresh token).
6. Add email verification flow (token model + sending).
7. Add password reset flow.
8. Add rate limiting, lockout, monitoring, and 2FA if needed.
9. Harden (key rotation, rotate refresh tokens, CSRF hardening) and run integration tests.

---

# 14 — Extra production tips

- Use **asymmetric JWT (RS256)** if multiple services must validate tokens without sharing a secret.
- Keep the **access token small** to reduce bandwidth.
- Consider storing user roles in token but still validate current role from DB for critical endpoints.
- Use Redis for session counters, rate limiting, and blacklists if needed.
- Keep refresh token DB cleanup via background job (reap expired tokens).
- Consider exposing `GET /sessions` so users can view and revoke active sessions.

If you want, I can now:

- Draft the **Prisma models** for `User`, `RefreshToken`, `EmailToken`.
- Produce the **Auth module folder skeleton** with DTOs, controllers, services, and Passport strategy signatures (no implementation), or
- Immediately produce **full code** for `signup`, `login`, and `me` endpoints (step-by-step) with DTOs, password hashing, JWT issuance, refresh token storage, cookie handling, and tests.

Which would you like me to do next?
